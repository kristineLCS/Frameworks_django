Project: Book Tracker (Booked)
- Use API to allow users to search for books and view details
- Allows users to track their progress and set reading goals
- 

- About.html -> page where users can post their thoughts and opinions on books they've read (aka post list)
- Profile stays as profile and updating details

Next step:
- Create admin login to be able to update db with books
- Allow users to save/track books
- 

To Do:
- Set up media folder to be able to store images (i.e button imgs) for website (Unit 7)
- Be able to add/save books
- Be able to rate books after saving
- Make a chat(?), inbox(?)
