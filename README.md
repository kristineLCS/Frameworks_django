DJANGO Project:

Booked & Busy is a book tracking app that user can use to track the bookso they have read. I used google Books API to collect books for my database hence allowing users to search for books. Users can create folders in their profile page and add books to their folders. They can name their folders any names they want and delete it anytime they want. In the Home page, there is an announcement board that displays new announcements. Only admins have access to posting new announcements. I also implemented a post page where users can post reviews of any books, or just post anything book related. An aditional function is the inbox function where users can message one another.
